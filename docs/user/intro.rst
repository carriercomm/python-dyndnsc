Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

Dyndnsc was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind.


#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

All contributions to Dyndnsc should keep these important rules in mind.

Goals
-----
*Dyndnsc* was born as a minimal module for use in the *ANGEL APP*, a p2p
filesystem on top of webdav. At the time, the command line interface was not
important. Now that time has passed, the goals are essentially to provide
both an easy to use command line tool as well as providing an OK API for
developers who want to add dyndns capabilities to their software. Also,
providing support for many different ways of detecting and updating IP/DNS
records is important.

MIT License
-----------

A large number of open source projects you find today are `GPL Licensed`_.
While the GPL has its time and place, it should most certainly not be your
go-to license for your next open source project.

Essentially, a project that is released as GPL cannot be used in any commercial
product without the product itself also being offered as open source.

The MIT, BSD, ISC, and Apache2 licenses are great alternatives to the GPL
that allow your open-source software to be used freely in proprietary,
closed-source software.

Requests is released under terms of `MIT License`_.
